			<li>
				Unfortunately, our expeditions were not to go unnoticed.

			<li>
				Soon enough we began to cross paths with intelligent alien life forms.

				And with their intelligence came Agendas and the desire to acquire all the resources that our planet has to offer.
			</li> 

			<br> 

			<li>
				Inevitably, they began to attack, one after the next, hell-bent on conquering our world.

			<br>

			<li>
				At first, we held them off, holding our own in this galactic warfare.
			</li>

			<br>

			<li>
				We showed the more malevolent aliens in the galaxy that we were not to be trifled with.

			<br>

			<li>
				However when it became evident that these aliens were unrelenting in their pursuit for galactic conquest, it was decided that we needed to establish a task force to keep these creatures at bay.

			<br>

			<li> Enter the Rangers:</li>
